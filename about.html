						<div class = "vision-text">
							Businesses don't fail for lack of vision. They fail when leadership doesn't scale. So much focus goes into building the business, but how much focus goes into building the business leader? <br/>

							As your business grows, decision fatigue, team misalignment, and conflict increases. Your roadmap becomes blurry and you shift to reactionary leadership with burnout looming. <br/>

							We are here to help you gain clarity and align your company so that you can scale. You don't need another adviser, just clarity in thought, action and communication. <br/>

							Actionable Leadership transforms you from a survivalist to a visionary leader. Book a complimentary consultation. <br/>

							<ul>
								<li> Live boldly </li>
								<li> Align your vision </li>
								<li> Unlock your potential </li>
